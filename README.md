<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

**Project 1:** [Conduct a Security Audit](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%202%20-%20Conduct%20a%20Security%20Audit%202.pdf) <br>
  - Reviewed the scope, goals, and risk assessment report details focused on the asset managed by the IT Department
(fictional company).
  - Self-assessment for controls and compliance checklist. The checklist includes PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC type 1 and SOC type 2.
  
**Project 2:** [Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%203%20-%20Use%20the%20NIST%20Cybersecurity%20Framework%20to%20respond%20to%20a%20security%20incident%201.pdf) <br>
  - Created a plan to improve the company's network security, utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).
  - Analyzed the incident of DDoS attack and integrated the analysis into general security strategy. Navigated through different steps outlined in the CSF, including identifying security risks, protecting internal assets, detecting potential security incidents, responding to incidents, and recovering affected systems.

**Project 3:** [Use Linux commands to manage file permissions](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%204%20-%20Use%20Linux%20commands%20to%20manage%20file%20permissions%201.pdf) <br>
  - Examined existing permissions on the file system, ensuring that users on the research team have the appropriate authorization. This involves determining if the current permissions align with the authorized access levels. If the permission does not match the intended authorization, the task was to modify the permissions to grant appropriate access to authorized users and revoke access from unauthorized users.
    
**Project 4:** [Apply filters to SQL queries](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%205%20-%20Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.pdf) <br>
  - The task in this scenario was to investigate potential security issues related to login attempts and employee machines by examining the organization's data in the employees and log_in_attempts tables. This involves using SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and analyze them to identify any security concerns. **(Filter with AND, OR, and NOT)**

**Project 5:** [Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%206%20-%20Analyze%20a%20vulnerable%20system%20for%20a%20small%20business%201.pdf) <br>
  - Conducted a vulnerability assessment of the e-commerce company's remote database server, which has been open to the public for the past three years.
  - Created a written report that clearly communicates the potential risks associated with this vulnerability to decision makers within the company. The report outlines how the open database server poses a risk to business operations and provided recommendations on how to secure it to mitigate these risks.

**Project 6:** [Document an incident with an incident handler's journal](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%207%20-%20Document%20an%20incident%20with%20an%20incident%20handler's%20journal%201.pdf) <br>
  - Respond to a ransomware security incident by documentation using 5 W's (Who, What, Where, When, and Why)

**Project 7:** [Update a file through a Python algorithm](https://github.com/zekemanalo/project-activities/blob/main/Portfolio%20Activity%209%20-%20Update%20a%20file%20through%20a%20Python%20algorithm.pdf) <br>
  - Created a Python Algorithm to check if any IP addresses on the remove list are present in the allow list and remove them if found.
  - Step-by-step instructions:

1. Read the contents of the allow list file and store the IP addresses in a list.
2. Read the contents of the remove list file and store the IP addresses in a separate list.
3. Iterate through each IP address in the remove list.
4. Check if the IP address exists in the allow list.
5. If the IP address is found in the allow list, remove it from the allow list.
6. Write the updated allow list back to the file, replacing the previous contents.
